# DataBaseProject
<h3>this project is a search engine containing a Ship database, where you can search for different type of Ship including their parts</h3>
The idea was for ship engineers to look for appropriate parts which belongs to a particular ship, meaning if the engineer was not sure which part goes to a certain ship then he would use our database to find the appropriate piece
